# How to use

## Gallery
- duplicate the `gallery` directory and name the folder after the candidate, followed by some random characters, e.g. `john-doe-n986s`
- see `example.html` for an example of how the end result should look and work, but do not show this url to the candidate!
- turn on GitHub pages
- check that the directory loads as a publicly-accessible web page
- send the candidate a link to the publicly-accessible page
- once the interview is over, disable GitHub pages and delete the new directory
